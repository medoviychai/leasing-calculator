# Leasing calculator

In each field, you can enter a value both from the keyboard and using the slider.

Each field has a maximum and minimum value - the slider restricts the user in selecting data, and when an incorrect value is entered from the keyboard, it is reset to the nearest correct number (maximum or minimum).

By clicking the “Submit Request” button, a request is generated that sends all the calculator data to an imaginary backend.
